# MarsColony App

The Mars Colony app was built on the AngularJS2 framework and was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.19-3.

The app collects the information of alien encounters from colonists on Mars.

## Project Goals
The app gets data (alien reports) from a JSON file as well as posts to it (registering a colonist and alien encounter.. 

It has form validation integrated using ngForm. 

## Learnings
The AngularJS 2 framework is a powerful way to build robust single page apps with completely contained structure, styling and interactions.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
